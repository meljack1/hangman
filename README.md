# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 2
In this milestone, I have implemented code which creates a list of words assigned to a variable called word_list. 

I have also added functionality for a user to input a letter of their choosing, and validation to check that only a single, alphabetical character has been provided by the user.
